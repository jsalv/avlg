/** <p>{@link AVLGTree}  is a class representing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL Tree</a> with
 * a relaxed balance condition. Its constructor receives a strictly  positive parameter which controls the <b>maximum</b>
 * imbalance allowed on any subtree of the tree which it creates. So, for example:</p>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>An AVL-1 tree is a classic AVL tree, which only allows for perfectly balanced binary
 *      subtrees (imbalance of 0 everywhere), or subtrees with a maximum imbalance of 1 (somewhere). </li>
 *      <li>An AVL-2 tree relaxes the criteria of AVL-1 trees, by also allowing for subtrees
 *      that have an imbalance of 2.</li>
 *      <li>AVL-3 trees allow an imbalance of 3.</li>
 *      <li>...</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>The idea behind AVL-G trees is that rotations cost time, so maybe we would be willing to
 *  accept bad search performance now and then if it would mean less rotations. On the other hand, increasing
 *  the balance parameter also means that we will be making <b>insertions</b> faster.</p>
